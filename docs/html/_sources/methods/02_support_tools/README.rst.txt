Task 2 | Integration of Municipal Tree points and Laser-detected Tree Crown polygons
=====================================================================================

This repository provides a workflow for preparing municipal tree data for 
i-Tree Eco analysis and extrapolating the results to full the study area 
extent, using the lidar-segmented tree crowns and auxiliary GIS datasets.

Code is provided for the following tasks:

1. **i-Tree Eco Data Preparation:** preparing an input dataset for i-Tree 
Eco analysis by supplementing existing municipal tree inventories with 
crown geometry from the ALS data and auxiliary spatial datasets following 
the workflow by *Cimburova and Barton (2020).*

Data
----

The following data sources were used within this project task.

**Land use**

In i-Tree Eco Land Use (LU) is defined as the land use type in which a tree is located. In i-Tree Eco, there are 13 default land use classes defined (see `Table 1 <tables.rst>`_).
The land resource map FKB-AR5 (Ahlstr√∏m et al. 2019, Kartverket, 2023b) and the land use map from SSB (2022) are combined, and the different land use classes are translated to the Land Use classes defined in i-Tree Eco `Table 2 <tables.rst>`_ and `Table 3 <tables.rst>`_.


Municipal Tree Inventory

Methods
-------

The workflow consists of three main steps:

1. Prepare Data

   **entry point:** ``prepare_data.py``

   **tasks:**

   a. load the lidar-segmented tree crown polygons from the ALS data per neighbourhood

   b. load the in situ tree stems from the municipal tree inventory

   c. clean the in situ tree stems

      - manual municipality-specific cleaning tasks (see Data)
      
      - automatic cleaning tasks:
         - set standard field design
         - translate tree species
         - ensure that each tree stem contains: stem_id, dbh, height, crown_diameter 

   d. group tree stem points by neighbourhood
      
2. Join the in situ tree stems with the lidar-segmented tree crowns
    
   **entry point:** ``join_data.py``

   **tasks:** 

   a. classify the geometrical relationship
   b. split lidar-segmented tree crowns that overlap with multiple tree stems
   c. model the crown geometry of tree stems that do not overlap with lidar-segmented trees
   d. quality control whether each crown polygon is assigned to a single tree stem
   e. join the in situ tree stems with the lidar-segmented tree crowns
   
   **Geometrical Relations:**

   - **Case 1:** one polygon contains one point (1:1), simple join.  
   - **Case 2:** one polygon contains more than one point (1:n), split crown with voronoi tesselation.
   - **Case 3:** a point is not overlapped by any polygon (0:1), model tree crown using oslo formula.
   - **Case 4:** a polygon does not contain any point (1:0), not used to train i-tree eco/dataset for extrapolation.

3. Compute tree attributes and auxiliary attributes
    
   **entry point:** ``compute_attributes.py``

   **tasks:** 

   a. compute tree crown attributes (all trees in the study area)

      - overlay attributes (pollution zone, neighbourhood code)
      - crown_id (based on neighbourhood code and objectid)
      - tree height, crown area 

   b. compute tree stem attributes (in-situ trees)

      - overlay attributes (e.g. pollution zone, neighbourhood code, land use) 
      - tree attributes (e.g. dbh, height, crown diameter)
      - join crown attributes (e.g. crown_id, crown area, crown volume, crown shape)
      - building-related attributes (e.g. building distance, building direction)
      - crown condition (e.g. crown light exposure)

.. warning::

   **Known Issues**

   - RUN the **building-related attributes** and **crown condition attributes** separately. 
   - Make a backup of the input data before running the scripts. 
   - Note that calculating the crown condition attributes is extremely slow (e.g., it can take more than 12 hours to run).
