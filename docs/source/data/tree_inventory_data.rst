Tree inventory data (in situ)
==============================


Bærum municipality tree inventory data
---------------------------------------

Bærum municipality provided four vector files with point data (Table 1). Each point represents a tree mapped according to the Natur i Norge (NiN) mapping manual or the håndbok 13 (DN13) mapping manual (Miljødirektoratet, 2021, Direktoratet for naturforvaltning, 2007). These trees were mapped for different purposes (monitoring of hollow oaks, old trees, or forest areas) than this project's purpose (quantifying the benefits of trees). Note that this can overrepresent cer-tain tree species, which could affect the outcomes of this study. 

The dataset contains 1465 single trees, 23 clustered trees and 765 urban forest areas. In this study we only consider the single tree localities registered within Bærum’s building zone, which are 1408 trees in total. See Appendix X for the summary statistics of this dataset.
