Task 3 | i-Tree Eco Modelling
=============================


The tree points of the municipality tree register that are cleaned and prepared in Task 2 are used as input for the i-Tree Eco model. 
This tool calculates ecosystem services and adds these physical and economic values as separate attributes to each tree point.

However, the goal is to obtain an estimate of these ecosystem services for all trees within the city's built-up area. 
Therefore, we use the tree points, which have been assessed by i-Tree Eco, along with machine learning techniques to predict the ecosystem services for all trees.
